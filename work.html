                    <p><strong>Crafting Contagious Connections</strong> grew out of my desire to create a space where learning feels alive — where the hands, heart, and head come together. Inspired by my grandmother's tactile ways of teaching, the project bridges vernacular, experiential learning with more abstract forms of modern education.</p>

                    <p>The project took shape in the KABK garden as a participatory space for workshops in spinning, natural dyeing, and eco-printing, using mostly local materials. The structure itself was built entirely from found and repurposed materials — old fabrics, reclaimed wood, and traditional wooden joints without a single metal screw. This choice reflected the project's ethos of care, circularity, and connection to the rhythms of craftsmanship.</p>

                    <p>It became a living, breathing space of intergenerational exchange and shared curiosity, where learning happens through doing, reflecting, and doing again. Rooted in John Dewey's ideas of experiential learning, <em>Crafting Contagious Connections</em> questions the Western tendency toward detached, theoretical education. Instead, it invites a more holistic, inclusive, and nature-integrated way of learning — one that values creativity, regeneration, and deep, tactile understanding.</p>

                <div class="project-text">
                    <p><strong>Rooting Ecologies</strong> is an ongoing action-based research that explores how gardens can become spaces of learning, negotiation, and regeneration in a time of climate disaster. The work draws inspiration from my upbringing in my grandmother's garden and evolved further in the KABK garden in The Hague — a once-neglected plot that has grown into a vibrant ecosystem of plants, pollinators, and community life.</p>

                    <p>Within such spaces, <em>Rooting Ecologies</em> cultivates encounters between people, soil, and place, transforming the act of gardening into a form of research, conversation, and care. The garden is not simply a site of cultivation, but a space of coexistence and dialogue where questions about the global and the bioregional are worked through in the presence of living systems.</p>

                    <p>Each seed sown and each weed pulled becomes part of a wider inquiry into how we might inhabit the Earth differently: how we might reconnect with the material, how artists respond to realities that sustain us, and how education itself might take root in the regenerative living world.</p>

                    <p>Through workshops, conversations, and collaborative planting, participants are invited to engage with the garden as both a pedagogical and ecological commons. Here, learning happens through doing, through touch, observation, weather, and growth. The garden becomes a site where theory and practice meet — where students and communities negotiate the tensions between extraction and regeneration, between global systems and local soils.</p>

                    <p>In an age defined by environmental collapse, <em>Rooting Ecologies</em> argues that every institution of higher education should nurture a garden — not as an ornamental gesture, but as an essential infrastructure for learning. Gardens bring climate literacy into the body, reconnect knowledge to place and time, and teach patience, collaboration, and reciprocity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Beyond Borders</strong> unfolds as a living story — a performative experience where materials speak, move, and remember. It invites us to trace the hidden pathways of the things that surround us: the fibers we wear, the metals we shape, the clays we mold, and the plastics that drift across oceans. Each carries its own rhythm, geography, and memory of touch and transformation.</p>

                    <p>This work explores how matter travels — mined, grown, traded, assembled, discarded — crossing borders both visible and invisible. Materials shift forms and meanings as they move through hands, lands, and systems of value, revealing our deep entanglement with worlds of production and desire.</p>

                    <p>Through storytelling, gesture, and sensory engagement, participants are invited to listen to the voices of materials — to sense the distances they have travelled, the care or neglect they have received, and the lives they have shaped. Each object becomes a witness to human intention and ecological consequence.</p>

                    <p><em>Beyond Borders</em> is a soft resistance to forgetfulness — a space of reflection that reminds us that every object, every thread, every fragment of matter is part of a vast, interconnected narrative. To encounter material is to encounter the world itself, its histories, its violences, and its tenderness.</p>
