          <p>Akash kumar (b. bokaro, jharkhand, India; based in the hague, netherlands) is an artist, researcher, and educator working at the intersection of material culture, with a focus on textiles, folklore, storytelling, and the transmission of knowledge. Rooted in hands-on making as both a method of inquiry and a medium for cultural exploration, his practice examines how and what skills, traditions, and wisdom are passed down across generations.</p>
          
          <p>Building on this foundation, kumar’s practice engages with the critical convergence between design, craft and art, exploring what becomes possible when the traditional binary between the three is dissolved. He creates spaces for collective learning where diverse cultural narratives and hands-on material practices meet, enabling the reimagining of inherited skills within modernity.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to his creative practice, he teaches and facilitates workshops for individuals of all ages, focusing on critical thinking, regenerative material, and collective creation. These workshops act as collaborative laboratories in which different forms of making coexist, transform, and inspire new possibilities for material and cultural exchange.</p>
          
          <p>Akash received his Master of Arts and Design from Royal Academy of Art (KABK), The Hague, where he explored the intersections of craft ecology and pedagogies of material culture. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Textile Design from the National Institute of Design (NID), ahmedabad, india.</p>

          <p>Having grown up in a farming family, akash is deeply connected to the land, its natural materials and rhythms. This connection informs his ongoing work in soil regeneration, ecological care, and the integration of traditional knowledge systems into contemporary approaches in art, design, soil and community care, positioning materiality not only as an artistic concern but as a lived, relational practice.</p>
